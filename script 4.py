### Important Note
Due to Streamlit Cloud's security restrictions, we cannot run ASReview Lab directly on this platform. 

Instead, you have two options:

1. **Run locally on your computer:**
```bash
pip install asreview
asreview lab
```
Then open http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

2. **Use ASReview Cloud:**
Visit [ASReview LAB](https://asreview.nl/asreview-lab/) to use the cloud version directly.

For more information, visit the [ASReview documentation](https://asreview.readthedocs.io/).

    Streamlit Cloud has certain limitations that prevent running ASReview Lab directly:
    
    1. **Port Access**: Streamlit Cloud doesn't allow opening additional ports needed by ASReview Lab
    2. **Process Management**: Long-running processes are not supported
    3. **Security Restrictions**: Direct network access is limited
    
    For the best experience, we recommend running ASReview Lab locally or using their cloud version.
